Description: Our hero is the Glitch Wizard. He's pretty confused, sometimes when
he gets hurt he turns into a more powerful wizard who can jump higher, move faster, and float longer. But then he gets hit again and is back to being an initiate.

Objective: Try to travel as far as you can without dying. Getting hurt isn't always that bad, sometimes it turns you into something
great!

Controls: Left/Right arrow keys to move, Space to jump.
